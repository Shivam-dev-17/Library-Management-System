# Project Title
Library Management System

## Problem Statement
Small libraries or departments need a simple system to manage books, keep track of which user borrowed which book, and produce basic reports (available books, issued books, overdue items). Manual tracking causes errors and is time-consuming.

## Scope
A desktop/console Java application implementing CRUD for books and users, issue/return workflows, search, and simple reports. Data persisted in an embedded SQLite database.

## Target Users
College library assistants, instructors, or students managing departmental libraries.

## High-level Features
- Book inventory (Add/Update/Delete/List/Search)
- User management (Register/Update/Delete/List)
- Issue / Return workflow with due date and simple overdue detection
- Reports: available books, issued books, user borrow history
- Simple CLI menu + optional small GUI later
